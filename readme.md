## These are few of my projects based on my knowledge and what I have learned in my on-going journey. some are too basic but I have still included them.
1.  These projects includes html and css. (With responsiveness) (except music page which I will finish soon).
2. Javascript projects (array/objects/string manipulation, DOM manipulation, constructors, classes, Date utiliztion, API, loops, EventListeners).
3. React projects (using components, React Hooks like useState, useRef, useEffect etc).
### Next will be tailwind based projects with react.
## Thank You.
